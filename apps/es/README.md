Project ES (Under construction)
-
**Completed BASIC CRUD Operations**
 - Create the required env files under `/config/development/.env`
 - Make sure to execute appropriate **nodemon.json** file
 - Run npm run `start:nodemon:dev:es` to start the app in watchable mode
 - Run `npm run build:webpack:dev:es`

For now basic `movies.json` dataset is created and used

**Under Consideration**
- Creating pipelines to import and ingest data from a DB
- Perform some large scale EQL query
