Project Graphql (Under construction)
- 
**Completed scaffolding required for graphQL**
- Create the required env files under `/config/development/.env`
- Make sure to execute appropriate **nodemon.json** file
- Run npm run `start:nodemon:dev:graphql` to start the app in watchable mode
- Run `npm run build:webpack:dev:graphql`

**Under Consideration**
- Planning to use prisma as the default graphql with apollo engine
- Call necessary modules based on usecase
